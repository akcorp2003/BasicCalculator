Division by zero handling.

## How Does it Work? ##

Click some buttons, or press them on your keyboard, and get your results displayed on the screen!

## Any Known Issues? ##

The one issue is that sometimes Windows freezes a button when you press the corresponding button on your keyboard. To resolve it, click another button on the screen and the button should be released.

## What's Next? ##

Since this is a really simple calculator program, the most important thing is getting a neat design. The next step would be making the buttons flashier and more appealing to a wide audience. I would leverage the power of WPF to design the eye-candy.
